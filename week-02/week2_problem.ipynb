Take care of the missing values**\n","- Beware not to encode missing values unless you are intending to do so.\n","- Sometimes you want to encode missing values to a separate cateogory. For example, when you want to predict if passengers of titanic had survived or not, missing data of certain features can actually have meaning, i.e., Cabin information can be missing because the body was not found.\n","\n","**2. Know which encoding and scaling method you should select**\n","- If your categories are ordinal, then it makes sense to use a LabelEncoder with a MinMaxScaler. For example, you can encode [low, medium, high], as [1,2,3], i.e., distance between low to high is larger than that of medium and high.\n","\n","- However, if you have non-ordinal categorical values, like [White, Hispanic, Black, Asian], then it would be better to use a OneHotEncoder instead of forcing ordinality with a LabelEncoder. Otherwise the algorithms you use (especially distance based algorithms like KNN) will make the assumption that the distance between White and Asian is larger than White and Hispanic, which is nonsensical.\n","\n","**3. Split before you encode to avoid data leakage**\n","- Split the dataset before you encode your data. It is natural for algorithms to see unknown values in the validation/test set that was not appearing in the train set. `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` is good at handling these unknown categories (`handle_unknown` parameter).\n","\n","- Discussion: What if you are certain about all the possible categories that can appear for each feature? Can you encode all the values before splitting the dataset into train and test set?\n","\n","\n","This notebook shows the three points in the following sections with
